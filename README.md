# Task Manager

This is a simple task manager program written in JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks by listing existing tasks, adding new tasks, and deleting tasks.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. The program will prompt you to enter commands for managing tasks.
4. Enter one of the following commands:
   - `list`: Displays all the tasks in the task list.
   - `new`: Adds a new task to the task list.
   - `delete`: Deletes a task from the task list.
   - `quit` or `q`: Quits the program.
5. Follow the prompts to complete the desired action.

## What You Can Learn

This program demonstrates the use of basic JavaScript concepts such as:

- Loops: The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input until they choose to quit.
- Conditional Statements: It uses `if` statements to determine the action to take based on the user's input.
- Arrays: Tasks are stored in an array, and the program manipulates this array to add, list, and delete tasks.
- User Input: The program utilizes the `prompt` function to get input from the user via the browser.

## Testing

- How loops work by observing how the program repeatedly asks for input.
- How conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on the user's input.
- How arrays can be used to store and manage data, such as tasks in this case.
- How to handle user input using JavaScript's `prompt` function.
